This repository contains the code for USL on CIFAR-10. The ImageNet versions are coming soon.

For further information regarding the paper, please contact [Xudong Wang](mailto:xdwang@eecs.berkeley.edu). For information regarding the code and implementation, please contact [Long Lian](mailto:longlian@berkeley.edu).


## Example Training Commands

Train USL on CIFAR-10
```
cd selective_labeling
python usl-cifar.py
```

Evaluate USL on CIFAR-10 with SimCLRv2-CLD
```
cd semisup-simclrv2-cld
python fine_tune.py
```

## Model Zoo
Coming soon.

## FAQ
Coming soon.
