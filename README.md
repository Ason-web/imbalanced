by [Xudong Wang*](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~xdwang/), [Long Lian*](https://tonylian.com/), and [Stella X. Yu](http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~stellayu/) at UC Berkeley/ICSI. (*: co-first authors)

To appear in *ECCV*, 2022.

This repository contains the code for USL on CIFAR-10. The ImageNet versions are coming soon.

Further information please contact [Xudong Wang](mailto:xdwang@eecs.berkeley.edu) (regarding the paper) and [Long Lian](mailto:longlian@berkeley.edu) (regarding this repo and code implementation).

## Example Training Commands

Train USL on CIFAR-10
```
cd selective_labeling
python usl-cifar.py
```

Evaluate USL on CIFAR-10 with SimCLRv2-CLD
```
cd semisup-simclrv2-cld
python fine_tune.py
```

## Model Zoo
Coming soon.

## FAQ
Coming soon.
